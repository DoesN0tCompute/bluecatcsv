  title: BlueCat Address Manager RESTful v2 API
  description: 'The **BlueCat Address Manager RESTful v2 API** is a new RESTful API
    for Address Manager that presents Address Manager objects as resources. Each resource
    has a unique endpoint, and related resources are grouped in collections. To fetch
    an individual resource, a `GET` request is sent to the resource''s endpoint. To
    fetch all resources in a collection, a `GET` request is sent to the collection''s
    endpoint.


    The RESTful v2 API is [hypermedia driven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS)
    and uses the [HAL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Application_Language)
    format for representing links. When navigating through the API, you can use those
    links to navigate to related resources or child resources of the requested endpoint.
    The API supports the following media types for most endpoints:  `application/hal+json`,
    `application/json`, and `text/csv`.  For authentication, the API supports both
    `Basic` and `Bearer` HTTP authentication schemes.


    To get started, create a session and receive credentials for `Basic` authentication
    by sending a `POST` request to the [/sessions](#/User%20and%20Group%20Resources/postSession)
    endpoint, with a message body containing the user''s credentials:


    ```{"username":"apiuser", "password":"apipass"}```


    The response will contain an `apiToken` field that can be entered with the username
    in the Swagger UI **Authorize** dialog. The response will also contain a `basicAuthenticationCredentials`
    field containing a base64 encoding of the requester''s username and API token
    delimited by a colon. This string can be injected directly into request `Authorization`
    headers in the following format:


    ```Authorization: Basic YXBpOlQ0OExOT3VIRGhDcnVBNEo1bGFES3JuS3hTZC9QK3pjczZXTzBJMDY=```


    For full details on API format and authentication methods, refer to the Address
    Manager RESTful v2 API Guide on the BlueCat Documentation Portal.'
